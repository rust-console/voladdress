//! `voladdress` is a crate that makes it easy to work with volatile memory
//! addresses (eg: memory mapped hardware).
//!
//! When working with volatile memory, it's assumed that you'll generally be
//! working with one or more of:
//!
//! * A single address (`VolAddress`)
//! * A block of contiguous memory addresses (`VolBlock`)
//! * A series of evenly strided memory addresses (`VolSeries`)
//!
//! All the types have `unsafe` _creation_ and then safe _use_, so that the
//! actual usage is as ergonomic as possible. Obviously you tend to use an
//! address far more often than you name an address, so that should be the best
//! part of the experience. Iterators are also provided for the `VolBlock` and
//! `VolSeries` types.
//!
//! For example, on the GBA there's a palette of 256  color values (`u16`) for
//! the background palette starting at `0x500_0000`, so you might write
//! something like
//!
//! ```rust
//! use typenum::consts::U256;
//! use voladdress::{VolBlock, VolAddress};
//!
//! pub type Color = u16;
//!
//! pub const PALRAM_BG: VolBlock<Color,U256> = unsafe { VolBlock::new(0x500_0000) };
//! ```
//!
//! And then in your actual program you might do something like this
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use typenum::consts::U256;
//! # use voladdress::{VolBlock, VolAddress};
//! # pub type Color = u16;
//! fn main() {
//! #  let palram = vec![0u16; 256];
//! #  let PALRAM_BG: VolBlock<Color,U256> = unsafe { VolBlock::new(palram.as_ptr() as usize) };
//!   let i = 5;
//!   // the palette is all 0 (black) at startup.
//!   assert_eq!(PALRAM_BG.index(i).read(), 0);
//!   // we can make that index blue instead.
//!   const BLUE: u16 = 0b11111;
//!   PALRAM_BG.index(i).write(BLUE);
//!   assert_eq!(PALRAM_BG.index(i).read(), BLUE);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! You _could_ use an address of any `*mut T` that you have (which is how the
//! tests and doctests work), but the _intent_ is that you use this crate with
//! memory mapped hardware. Exactly what hardware is memory mapped where depends
//! on your target device. Please read your target device's documentation.
//!
//! # Why Use This?
//!
//! It may seem rather silly to have special types for what is basically a `*mut
//! T`. However, when reading and writing with a normal pointer (eg: `*ptr` or
//! `*ptr = x;`) Rust will desugar that to the
//! [read](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/fn.read.html) and
//! [write](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/fn.write.html) functions. The
//! compiler is allowed to elide these accesses if it "knows" what the value is
//! already going to be, or if it "knows" that the read will never be seen.
//! However, when working with memory mapped hardware the read and write
//! operations have various side effects that the compiler isn't aware of, so
//! the access must not be elided. You have to use
//! [read_volatile](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/fn.read_volatile.html)
//! and
//! [write_volatile](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/fn.write_volatile.html),
//! which are immune to being elided by the compiler. The rust standard library
//! doesn't have a way to "tag" a pointer as being volatile to force that
//! volatile access always be used, and so we have this crate.
//!
//! There are other crates that address the general issue of volatile memory,
//! but none that I've seen are as easy to use as this one. They generally
//! expect you to cast the target address (a `usize` that you get out of your
//! hardware manual) into their crate's volatile type (eg: `let p = 1234 as *mut
//! VolatileCell<u16>`), but then you have to dereference that raw pointer _each
//! time_ you call read or write, and it always requires parenthesis too,
//! because of prescience rules (eg: `let a = (*p).read();`). You end up with
//! `unsafe` blocks and parens and asterisks all over the code for no benefit.
//!
//! This crate is much better than any of that. Once you've decided that the
//! initial unsafety is alright, and you've created a `VolAddress` value for
//! your target type at the target address, the `read` and `write` methods are
//! entirely safe to use and don't require the manual de-reference.
//!
//! # Can't you impl `Deref`/`DerefMut` and `Index`/`IndexMut` on these things?
//!
//! No. Absolutely not. They all return `&T` or `&mut T`, which use normal reads
//! and writes, so the accesses can be elided by the compiler. In fact
//! references end up being _more_ aggressive about access elision than happens
//! raw pointers. For standard code this is exactly what we want (it makes the
//! code faster to skip reads and writes we don't need), but with memory mapped
//! hardware this is the opposite of a good time.

use core::{cmp::Ordering, iter::FusedIterator, marker::PhantomData, num::NonZeroUsize};
use typenum::marker_traits::Unsigned;

// Note(Lokathor): We have to hand implement all the traits for all of our types
// manually because if we use `derive` then they only get derived if the `T` has
// that trait. However, since we're acting like various "pointers" to `T`
// values, the capabilities we offer aren't at all affected by whatever type `T`
// ends up being.

/// Abstracts the use of a volatile memory address.
///
/// If you're trying to do anything other than abstract a memory mapped hardware
/// device then you probably want one of the many other smart pointer types in
/// the standard library.
///
/// It's generally expected that you'll create `VolAddress` values by declaring
/// `const` globals at various points in your code for the various memory
/// locations of the device. This is fine, but please note that volatile access
/// is **not synchronized** and you'll have to arrange for synchronization in
/// some way if you intend to have a multi-threaded program.
///
/// An interrupt running on a core can safely communicate with the main program
/// running **on that same core** if both are using volatile access to the same
/// location. Of course, since you generally can't be sure what core you're
/// going to be running on, this "trick" should only be used for single-core
/// devices.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// In order for values of this type to operate correctly they must follow quite
/// a few safety limits:
///
/// * The declared address must always be
///   "[valid](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/index.html#safety)" according
///   to the rules of `core::ptr`.
/// * To be extra clear: the declared address must be non-zero because this type
///   uses the `NonZeroUsize` type internally (it makes the iterators a lot
///   better). It's possible to have a device memory mapped to the zero address,
///   but it is not ever valid to access the null address from within Rust. For
///   that rare situation you'd need to use inline assembly.
/// * The declared address must be aligned for the declared type of `T`.
/// * The declared address must always read as a valid bit pattern for the type
///   `T`, regardless of the state of the memory mapped hardware. If there's any
///   doubt at all, you must instead read or write an unsigned int of the
///   correct bit size (`u16`, `u32`, etc) and then parse the bits by hand.
/// * Any `VolAddress` declared as a compile time `const` must not use a
///   location that would ever be part of any allocator and/or stack frame.
/// * Any `VolAddress` made at runtime from a `*mut` pointer is only valid as
///   long as that `*mut` would be valid, _this is not tracked_ because pointers
///   don't have lifetimes.
///
/// If you're not sure about any of those points, please re-read the hardware
/// specs of your target device and its memory map until you know for sure.
///
/// The _exact_ points of UB are if the address is ever 0 (because it's stored
/// as `NonNullUsize`), or if you ever actually `read` or `write` with an
/// invalidly constructed `VolAddress`.
